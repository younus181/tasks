    <P>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the foundational language used to create and structure content on the web. It is the backbone of every webpage, defining the structure and layout of content such as text, images, links, and multimedia. HTML works alongside CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity) to create modern, dynamic websites.
