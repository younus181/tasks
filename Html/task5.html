            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript)."Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.

            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language designed to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.

It allows you to apply styles to HTML documents by prescribing colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning.
The main advantages are the separation of content (in HTML) and styling (in CSS) and the same CSS rules can be used across all pages and not have to be rewritten.
HTML uses tags and CSS uses rule sets.
CSS styles are applied to the HTML element using selectors.

                JavaScript is a versatile, dynamically typed programming language used for interactive web applications, supporting both client-side and server-side development, and integrating seamlessly with HTML, CSS, and a rich standard library.

                JavaScript is a single-threaded language that executes one task at a time.
                It is an Interpreted language which means it executes the code line by line.
                The data type of the variable is decided at run-time in JavaScript that's why it is called dynamically typed.
