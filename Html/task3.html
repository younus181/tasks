        <center><h1>Agile Methodology</h1></center>
           <p><b>Agile Methodology</b> is a modern, iterative, and flexible approach to software development and project management. It emphasizes collaboration, customer feedback, and the ability to adapt to changing requirements. Agile is widely used in software development but has also been adopted in other industries due to its effectiveness in managing complex projects.
           It promotes continuous iteration of development and testing throughout the lifecycle of the project.
           Agile is based on the Agile Manifesto, which outlines four core values and twelve principles.

        <h1><center>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</h1></body>
            <p>The <b>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</b> is a structured process used by software development teams to design, develop, test, and deploy high-quality software. It provides a framework for planning, controlling, and monitoring the progress of a software project. The SDLC ensures that the final product meets customer requirements and is delivered on time and within budget.
             Each phase has specific goals, deliverables, and activities.The SDLC helps teams manage complexity, reduce risks, and ensure quality.
